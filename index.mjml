        <h1>Measuring a Foundation's Performance</h1>
      </mj-text>
      <mj-text padding-top=0 padding-bottom=0>
        <p>The Spencer Foundation, one of the nation’s premier education research foundations, must spend 5 percent of its Read More > than $525 million endowment each year. Yet how can one define “success” when it comes to this expenditure—particularly when its effects will not be evident for years to come? Michael McPherson, president of the Spencer Foundation, addressed this conundrum in a special lecture on November 10 held at Northwestern University’s Evanston campus.</p>

        <h3>Faculty Spotlight: Leslie McCall</h3>
        <img style='float:right; margin: 13px 0 13px 13px;' src='faculty-spotlight.jpg' /><p>Long before Occupy Wall Street or presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders raised the issue of income inequality, IPR sociologist Leslie McCall was fixated on the topic. As a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, in the late 1980s and 1990s, an era when the barometer on “inequality started increasing,” she began following its upward climb. Since then, her interest in inequality has fueled two books and many journal articles and book chapters, as well as a growing list of projects. <a href="#" class='link'>Read More ></a></p>

        <h3>Helping Central Banks Think About Uncertainty and Expectations</h3>
        <p>IPR economist Charles F. Manski was an invited presenter at the third International Monetary Fund (IMF) Statistical Forum in Frankfurt, on November 19. Manski presented his work on expectations to approximately 200 international economists, statisticians, central bankers, and other invited guests. He emphasized it was particularly important for central banks in situations where heterogeneity is a central determinant of policy outcomes. He went on to address his research insights on how to collect, analyze, and interpret expectations data, drawing on his extensive past work on measuring probabilistic expectations. <a href="#" class='link'>Read More ></a></p>

        <h3>Connecting Compensation and Skill</h3>
        <p>When you go to work for the government versus a private sector company, you likely do so with the understanding that you will earn less working for your state or local government than say, Tim Cook at Apple. But is this true? And, if so, why? Recent research by law professor and IPR associate Max Schanzenbach reassesses this public-sector pay gap—the difference in earnings between public- and private-sector workers—to determine how differences in skill might account for those in pay. <a href="#" class='link'>Read More ></a></p>

        <p>Twenty years ago, when a student wanted to learn about a historical topic outside the classroom, the options were limited to a trip to the library or the bookstore. Today, she or he can access vast amounts of digital content after a quick search engine result or join an online fan community. But now that almost anyone can post historical fact (or fiction) on the web, has this jeopardized legitimate historical discourse? Digital learning expert and IPR associate Jolie Matthews examines how people talk about history in an online fan community. <a href="#" class='link'>Read More ></a>

Tracking data for thousands of students affected by the reform, Bianchi unearthed the unintended consequences of making education Read More > accessible. <a href="#" class='link'>Read More ></a></p>

        <h3>"How Do Right-to-Carry Laws Affect Crime Rates? Coping with Ambiguity Using Bounded-Variation Assumptions" <a href="#" class='link'>(WP-15-17)</a></h3>
        <p><i>Charles F. Manski and John V. Pepper</i></p>
        <p>Despite dozens of studies, research on crime in the United States has struggled to reach consensus about the impact of right-to-carry (RTC) gun laws. Empirical results are highly sensitive to seemingly minor variations in the data and model. How then should research proceed? Manski and Pepper think that policy analysis is most useful if researchers perform inference under a spectrum of assumptions of varying identifying power, recognizing the tension between the strength of assumptions and their credibility. With this in mind, they formalize and apply a class of assumptions that flexibly restrict the degree to which policy outcomes might vary across time and space. They find there are no simple answers; empirical findings are sensitive to assumptions, and vary over crimes, years, and states.</p>

        <p><i>David Autor, David Figlio, Krzysztof Karbownik, Jeffrey Roth, and Melanie Wasserman</i></p>
        <p>The authors explore why boys fare worse than girls in households of low socioeconomic status—both behaviorally and educationally—by using matched birth certificates, health, disciplinary, academic, and high school graduation records for Read More > than 1 million children born in Florida between 1992 and 2002. Relative to their sisters, boys born to low-education and unmarried mothers, raised in low-income neighborhoods, and enrolled at poor-quality public schools have higher rates of truancy and behavioral problems throughout elementary and middle school, exhibit Read More > behavioral and cognitive disability, perform worse on standardized tests, are less likely to graduate high school, and are Read More > likely to commit serious crimes as juveniles. A surprising implication of these findings is that, relative to white siblings, black boys fare worse than their sisters in significant part because black children—both boys and girls—are raised in Read More > disadvantaged family environments.</p>

        <h3>"The Political Relevance of Irrelevant Events" (WP-15-14) <a href="#" class='link'>(WP-15-14)</a></h3>
        <p><i>Ethan Busby, James Druckman, and Alexandria Fredendall</i></p>
        <p>Do events irrelevant to politics affect citizens’ political opinions? A growing literature suggests that such events, such as athletic competitions and shark attacks, shape political preferences, raising concerns about citizen competence. The researchers offer a framework for studying these kinds of effects on preferences. The researchers find that irrelevant events can influence attitudes, mood, and public declarations. However, they also find that, when it comes to political attitudes, the irrelevant event effects appear to be short-lived. They conclude that, despite their demonstration of irrelevant event effects, it is premature to conclude such events play a substantial role in affecting citizens’ political opinions.</p>
